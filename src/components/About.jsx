          I love travelling, food, video games, and last but not least, coding.
          I've always wanted to turn a hobby into my job, and as you can see,
          most of my hobbies are hard to build a career out of. For years, I
          assumed I could get a job that I could tolerate but not love. So, I'm
          incredibly relieved that I stumbled into coding.

          I got my first break into software development when I needed to
          monitor online stock levels of certain shoes for my reselling
          business. I knew that code would be the answer to my problems, so I
          picked up Python to create a script that would notify me of stock
          changes instantly, so I could purchase them before they went out of
          stock. This proved to be successful and Iâ€™ve been hooked ever since.
          Recognising the need for formal education, I turned to{" "}
          <span className={"text-emerald-300"}>Northcoders</span> to solidify my
          skills. So I got onto a cohort months down the line to give me time to
          sharpen my <span className={"text-emerald-300"}>JavaScript</span>{" "}
          skills before joining. I successfully completed their software
          development course and graduated in November 2023.
