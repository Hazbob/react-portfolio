          I love traveling, food, video games, and last but not least, coding.
          I've always wanted to turn a hobby into my job, and most of my
          hobbies, as you can see, are hard to build a career out of. For years,
          I assumed I could get a job that I could tolerate but not love. So,
          I'm incredibly relieved that I stumbled into coding.

          When i first started coding I engaged in extensive self-learning
          through Udemy courses. Initially, I delved into{" "}
          <span className={"text-emerald-300"}>Python</span> to craft scripts
          that significantly aided my business, generating approximately Â£600 in
          revenue by December 2022. Recognizing the need for formal education, I
          turned to <span className={"text-emerald-300"}>Northcoders</span> to
          solidify my skills. So I got on a cohort months down to give me time
          to sharpen my JS skills before I Join. I successfully completed their
          software development course and graduated in November 2023.
